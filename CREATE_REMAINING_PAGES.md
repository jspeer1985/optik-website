# REMAINING PAGES TO CREATE

Due to message limits, I've created the FOUNDATION. 

**WHAT'S DONE:**
✅ package.json
✅ tailwind.config.ts (OPTIK Blue theme)
✅ globals.css (all styling)
✅ layout.tsx (root layout)
✅ Navbar component
✅ Footer component  
✅ HOME page (complete with hero, stats, features)

**WHAT YOU NEED TO ADD:**
These are standard pages - copy from your existing site or I'll create in next message:

1. /app/tokenomics/page.tsx
2. /app/roadmap/page.tsx
3. /app/airdrop/page.tsx
4. /app/whitepaper/page.tsx
5. /app/about/page.tsx
6. /app/dex/page.tsx (copy from your current site)
7. /app/launchpad/page.tsx (copy from your current site)
8. /app/dashboard/page.tsx (simplified version)

**QUICK SETUP:**
1. Copy this optik-launch folder to your ~/optik-website
2. Run: npm install
3. Run: npm run dev
4. You'll see the professional home page with OPTIK Blue theme!

Then we add remaining pages one by one.
